## Instructions
1. Create a new React Native app locally
2. Use the included .sketch file to get design requirements
3. Build out as much of the design as you can in the alloted time
4. Document assumptions or methods as needed
5. Have fun
6. Ask questions if you need to

## Notes and Requirements
The design is for a "10 week program" with a series of instruction for the user to follow each week for 10 weeks.
- Each week has subsets of checklist items
- Once all checks are checked the "Unlock Week #" button is activated
- "Unlock Week #" navigates to # week
- Once all checks are checked for "Week 10" the "Finish Program" button is activated
- "Finish Program" button press shows "Congrats!" text
- When the user navigates to previous weeks, the "Restart Program" button is displayed 
- The "Restart Program" button restarts the app to the initial state
- "Begin Program" button activates "Week 1"
- "Order the book" button press - opens any random link on Amazon
- The state of the app should persist on the phone (allowing the user to close/reopen without losing progress)
- No limitations for any additional libraries to use.

## Deliverables:
- Source code (host in a git repo and share access to it)
- Video demo of your app
